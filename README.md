# About The Project: Your Local Library

This project is part of a series of my personal portfolio projects.
It started from the idea of creating an app that would allow people to lend and borrow books to and from others that reside in the area.
Since this is not an actual app that has users that would generate the dataset needed to access the functionalities, I created an arbitrary dataset "bookList.js" that I used for this project.

## Usage

### 0. Navigation

- Your Local Library -- Navigates to top of the page.
- Booksearch -- Navigates to search bar.
- Filter -- Navigates to filter options.
- Wishlist -- Navigates to wishlist.

### 1. Booksearch

The 'Booksearch' field allows the user to search for a book by typing in either the name of the book or the author.

### 2. Filter

The user is able to filter the books by availability and security deposit.

### 3. Wishlist

By clicking the heart-shaped button on the top-right of each book image, the user can add the desired book to their wishlist.
Once added to the wishlist, the book can be removed by clicking the 'remove' button, which is to the right of the book title.

### 4. Books

The user can scroll up and down to look at the books in the area. Basic information (title, author, publisher, availability, security deposit) is displayed under the book cover. When the user clicks on a book, a modal page will appear. This modal page contains information about the lender (name, area, and book description) and will provide an option to "request lender" to borrow the book. The user can close the modal by either clicking the 'close' button or by clicking anywhere outside of the modal.
